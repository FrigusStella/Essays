<h1> Javascript is easy.... Sort of </h1>

I am someone who hasn't had a lot of experience with writing javascript, or at least, does not remember a lot about what I had learned. At the very least, compared to my previous semester learning C language, it seems very similar in structure and how things are written. Javascript as a language is really easy to learn, and is straightforward, somewhat unlike some other languages...kind of like an easier C.
